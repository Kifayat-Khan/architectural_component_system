  "info": "Lin Chih-chu Memorial Hall (林之助紀念館) is a Japanese-style wooden residence in Taichung, built in 1928 as a teacher’s dormitory beside Liuchuan River. Lin Chih-chu, known as the Father of Taiwanese Gouache Painting, lived and worked here for sixty years from 1946. In 2007, it was designated a historic building and later restored, reopening to the public in 2015. Inside, visitors find preserved wooden architecture, tatami rooms, Lin’s personal painting tools, and exhibitions on gouache art. Exhibits include his pigments, brushes, and furniture, giving insight into his daily creative environment. The hall hosts cultural programs and connects community life with Taiwan’s art history.Lin Chih-chu (林之助, 1917–2008) was born in Taichung. He studied at the Imperial Art School in Japan under masters Okumura Togyu and Yamaguchi Hoshun. At age 24, his painting 'Morning Cool' was selected into Japan’s Imperial Year 2600 Exhibition. Returning to Taiwan in 1941, he taught at Taichung Normal School and became a key art educator. He pioneered gouache painting in Taiwan, blending Western realism with traditional Nihonga influences. In the 1950s he focused on landscapes and bird-and-flower painting. He co-founded art societies and in 1981 established the Taiwan Provincial Gouache Association, serving as chairman. In 2015, 'Morning Cool' was designated a national cultural artifact. Lin passed away in 2008 in Los Angeles, but his legacy continues through his works and the memorial hall, which symbolizes his contribution to Taiwanese art and education.",
